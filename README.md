# üõ°Ô∏è DrishtIQ ‚Äî User & Entity Behavior Analytics System

> **AI-driven insider threat detection system** powered by machine learning and behavior analytics.  
> Built with **React (frontend)**, **Node.js (backend)**, and **Python (ML model)** to identify anomalous user activities using real log data.  
> Future scope includes **blockchain-based audit trails**, **desktop agent integration**, and **defense-grade tamper resistance**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**DrishtIQ** is an intelligent platform that detects **insider threats** and **suspicious behavior** within an organization by analyzing user activity patterns.  

Traditional cybersecurity tools focus on *external attacks*, but insider threats often come from *trusted users*, making them harder to detect.  
DrishtIQ addresses this by using **machine learning** to learn normal behavioral patterns and flag deviations as potential threats.

## üß† Core Components

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Engine (Python)
- Reads **user behavior data** (from CSV logs).  
- Processes and normalizes features like login time, bytes sent, file size, and event frequency.  
- Uses **unsupervised ML algorithms** (e.g., Isolation Forest / One-Class SVM) for anomaly detection.  
- Generates:
  - `risk_scores.csv` ‚Äî anomaly scores for each user/session  
  - `alerts.csv` ‚Äî list of users/events exceeding anomaly threshold  
- Built using:  
  **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **NumPy**

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Server (Node.js)
- Acts as the **bridge** between ML and the frontend.  
- Responsible for:
  - Serving ML-generated data (alerts, scores, logs) via REST APIs.  
  - Handling client requests from React dashboard.  
  - Managing communication and updates between UI and ML engine.  
- Built using:  
  **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Multer (for CSV uploads)**, **CORS**, **Axios**

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Dashboard (React.js)
- Provides a **real-time visualization** of user and entity behavior.  
- Displays:
  - Risk scores
  - Anomaly alerts
  - Historical trends (charts)
  - CSV upload and analysis results  
- Designed with:  
  **React.js**, **Chart.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Axios**

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Flow (Prototype)
1. Admin uploads or streams **user activity logs (CSV)**.  
2. Backend forwards data to ML engine for analysis.  
3. ML model computes **risk scores** and flags anomalies.  
4. Processed results are displayed in the React dashboard as visual charts and alert tables.

---

## üìä Features (Current Prototype)

‚úÖ Upload and process user activity logs (CSV)  
‚úÖ ML-based anomaly detection and risk scoring  
‚úÖ Interactive dashboard with alert visualization  
‚úÖ REST APIs for ML-to-frontend communication  
‚úÖ Real-time rendering of detection results  
‚úÖ Modular, extensible architecture  

---

## üßÆ Machine Learning Logic (Simplified)

**Algorithm:** Isolation Forest  
**Steps:**
1. Train on normal behavior logs.  
2. Compute anomaly scores for each record.  
3. Label outliers as ‚Äúsuspicious.‚Äù  
4. Output a ranked list of alerts with confidence values.
